Netflix WebCrypto (NfWebCrypto)
================================

Netflix WebCrypto is a polyfill of the [W3C Web Cryptography API](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/),
22 April 2013 Editor's Draft, as a native Chrome PPAPI plugin. Unlike a javascript polyfill, the native implementation
supports a stronger security model with no key material exposed to javascript. The goal is to make the Web Crypto
Javascript API [freely available](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) to web
developers for experimentation and use prior to its implementation by browser vendors.

Currently only Google Chrome / Chromium on linux amd64 is supported.

Features
--------

NfWebCrypto does not implement the Web Crypto API in its entirety, due to
limitations of browser plugin technology and initial focus on operations and
algorithms most useful to Netflix. However, the existing feature set supports
many typical and common crypto use cases targeted by the Web Crypto API.

Supported

* Interfaces supported:
  + Key, KeyPair
  + KeyOperation
  + CryptoOperation
* SubtleCrypto interface methods supported
  + encrypt, decrypt
  + sign, verify
  + generateKey
  + exportKey, importKey
  + wrapKey, unwrapKey
* Key formats supported
  + symmetric keys: raw and jwk (raw)
  + asymmetric keys: pkcs#8 (public), spki (private), and jwk (public only)
* Algorithms supported
  + HMAC SHA-256: sign, verify, importKey, exportKey, generateKey
  + AES-128 CBC w/ PKCS#5 padding: encrypt, decrypt, importKey, exportKey, generateKey
  + RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5: sign, verify, importKey, generateKey
  + RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5: encrypt, decrypt, importKey, exportKey, generateKey
  + Diffie-Hellman: generateKey, deriveKey
  + RSA-OAEP: wrapKey*, unwrapKey*
  + AES-KW: wrapKey*, unwrapKey*

*Wrap/Unwrap operations follow the Netflix [KeyWrap Proposal](http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/wiki/KeyWrap_Proposal)
and support protection of the JWE payload with AES128-GCM.
It is be possible to wrap/unwrap the following key types: HMAC SHA-256 and AES-128 CBC.

Not Supported

* The streaming/progressive processing model in not supported
* Synchronous API's like getRandomValues() are not supported
* Algorithm normalizing rules are not fully implemented
* keyUsage is not currently enforced

Moving forward, Netflix will continue to enhance this implementation and try to keep it as much in sync as possible
with the latest draft Web Crypto API spec.

Requirements
------------

Linux

* Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit with build-essential, libssl-dev-1.0.1c or later, and cmake 2.8 or later
* 64-bit Google Chrome / Chromium R22 or later (tested with R27)

Directory Tour
--------------

    base/
        Common C++ source for both the plugin and crypto component.
    cmake/
        Cmake toolchain files.
        Linux desktop builds use the linux system build tools and libs.
        Only 64-bit builds are supported for now.
    crypto/
        C++ source for the crypto component. The contents of this directory is
        of primary interest to native devs; the entry point is the CadmiumCrypto
        class. This directory currently builds to an archive file.
    crypto/test/
        Contains C++ gtest unit tests that exercise the CadmiumCrypto class
        interface. Not fleshed out yet and currently not built.
    misc/
        Miscellaneous code to support development. Currently has code to run and
        debug the Chrome browser with the plugin properly registered.
    plugin/
        C++ source of the PPAPI plugin. This code builds to shared library that
        is dl-loaded by the browser when the plugin is registered. It handles
        interfacing with the browser, bridging to the crypto thread, and decode/
        dispatch of JSON messages to and from the browser. Native devs will
        probably only be interested in the NativeBridge class here.
    web/nfcrypt.js
        The javascript front-end for the plugin. The bottom level of this code
        handles the transport of JSON-serialized messages to and from the
        plugin, while the top level implements the W3C WebCrypto interface.
        Native devs will need to change the bottom level to match their bridge
        API. This source file borrows heavily from polycrypt (polycrypt.net)
    web/test_qa.html
        The Jasmine HTML unit tests that exercise the javascript WebCrypto
        API exposed to the javascript client by nfcrypt.js.
        

How to Build
------------
The following has been verified on Ubunutu 12.04. cmake 2.8 or later is required.

    $ mkdir buildDir
    $ cd buildDir
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=(repo)/cmake/toolchains/linux64.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug|Release] (repo)
    $ make -j<N>

Build Results
-------------

Browser plugin - This is registered and run within the Chrome browser.

    (buildDir)/plugin/libnfwebcrypto.so
    (buildDir)/plugin/nfwebcrypto.info
    
Native gtest unit test executable (if built). This is run from the command
line.

    (buildDir)/crypto/test/test
    
Native CadmiumCrypto archive. Native apps will link to this archive.

    (buildDir)/crypto/libcadcrypto.a


How to run the Unit Tests
-------------------------

Chrome must be run with a special command line option to register the plugin.
The easiest way to do this is to use the provided start.sh script, which employs
the .info file generated by the build.

Make a directory and copy or symlink start.sh, libnfwebcrypto.so, and
nfwebcrypto.info.

    $ mkdir runNfWebCrypto
    $ cd !$
    $ ln -s (repo)/misc/desktop/start.sh
    $ ln -s (buildDir)/plugin/libnfwebcrypto.so
    $ ln -s (buildDir)/plugin/nfwebcrypto.info

The start.sh script depends on the chrome executable present at
/opt/google/chrome/chrome. Edit the script if this is not true. Finally, start
chrome and run the [unit tests hosted on github](http://netflix.github.io/NfWebCrypto/web/test_qa.html)
by running the script.

    $ ./start.sh
    
Note that there must not be any other chrome instance running in the system
before the script is executed. Otherwise the action will be to just open a new
tab on the existing instance without loading the plugin.

The unit tests will run automatically and all should pass.

Sample Code
-----------

Please see the javascript unit tests for examples of how to operate the
Web Crypto API.

TODO - add some simple examples here
